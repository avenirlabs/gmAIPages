- Currency symbol changed from $ to ₹ (Unicode: ₹)
- Price amounts scaled appropriately (₹500/₹1000 vs $50/$100)
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing price data
- Enhanced pattern matching for better user input recognition

**Test Results**:
- ✅ Chat refinement chips now show "Under ₹500" and "Under ₹1000"
- ✅ Product prices display correctly as ₹399, ₹88, ₹289
- ✅ WooCommerce API returns numeric prices instead of strings
- ✅ AI service recognizes both "under 500" and "under 1000" patterns
